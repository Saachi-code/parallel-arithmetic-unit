## ðŸ“– Summary
This project presents the **design, verification, synthesis, and testing** of a **Parallel Arithmetic Unit (PAU)** that integrates an adder and a multiplier in a fully combinational design.  

The work includes:
- Verilog design of adder, multiplier, and integrated PAU module  
- Functional verification in **ModelSim**  
- Synthesis using **Synopsys Design Compiler** with NanGate 45nm library  
- Post-synthesis simulation for gate-level verification  
- **ATPG (Automatic Test Pattern Generation)** using **Synopsys TetraMAX** for fault coverage analysis
